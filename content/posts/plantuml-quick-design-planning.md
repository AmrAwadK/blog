# Motivation

It's often the case that a software project the does something meaningful can gradually grow into a very complex system, having the ability to visualize the different components and states of the software can make a big difference in understanding the system.

Since I have first learned about UML, I found that it works great for representing complexity in a way that's easy to reason about, at many points in the different projects I worked on, I was always reaching for a UML diagram to quickly share my thoughts with my teammates in an easy to grasp way.

But the problem I was running into was that creating a UML diagram takes time. While a wide range of tools is available, I felt like I was hendered by having to navigate the user inteerface, and being the perfectionist I am, I would spend more time formatting the diagram as it grows than adding information to it! It just didn't feel right.

There had to be another way where I didn't have to sacrifice the quality of the visual representation to save time
