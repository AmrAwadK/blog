I'm a software engineer who like building things.

I'm a firm believer that the most important skill an engineer can have is problem solving. With the current state of technology, and everything moving too fast. It's easy to get lost in the vast space of new programming languages, frameworks and tools, but going back to that single rule helps keep me grounded and focused.

I'm an avid reader in TDD, design patterns, OOP, advanced Python features and best practices. This helps me greatly implement well designed solutions with clean code, test coverage and comprehensive documentation.
